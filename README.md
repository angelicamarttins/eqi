# Technical Test

This project is the result of a technical test proposed by [EQI Investimentos](https://eqi.com.br/). The main object was to create a investiments simulator, which was mandatory to consume the data from a fake API made by the company. The input should validate the user entry and, in case of the user type text instead number, a message error must display under the input. Despite user input, the card results should display the data recived from fake API when submit button was clicked.

Here is the wireframe sent by the company:
